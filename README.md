# Robot
This is the journal/code repository for a physical robot I am working on to test some of the AI software I do in a real system.
My intent is to use an Arduino computer for sensor/motor control, with a Raspberri Pi for high-level AI and vision.  Hardware is a simple 4-wheel platform purchased as a kit.

##  Parts
The following parts have been used for this robot

  * DFRobot 4WD Platform with encoders
  * DFRobot Romeo V 1.3 Arduino compatible controller with motor controllers

##  Current Work
  * Adding capacitors and connection wires to motors (Do this before assembly!)

##  Construction History/Notes
