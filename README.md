# Robot
This is the journal/code repository for a physical robot I am working on to test some of the AI software I do in a real system.
My intent is to use an Arduino computer for sensor/motor control, with a Raspberri Pi for high-level AI and vision.  Hardware is a simple 4-wheel platform purchased as a kit.

##  Parts
The following parts have been used for this robot

  * DFRobot 4WD Platform with encoders
  * DFRobot Romeo V 1.3 Arduino compatible controller with motor controllers
  * 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors (4)

##  Current Work
  * Motor tests
  * Figuring out how to mount the controllers/computers

##  Construction History/Notes
  * (5/7/16) Added capacitors and connection wires to motors (Do this before assembly!) \[Image 1\]
  * (5/9/16) Motors, encoders, and wheels added to base. \[Comment 1\]
  
##  Comments
  1. - The instructions for putting on the wheel encoders doesn't place the sensor correctly.  There is plenty of hardware provided to adjust the spacing.  Play with it till it works.
